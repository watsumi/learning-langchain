"""
The below example will use a SQLite connection with the Chinook database, which is a sample database that represents a digital media store. Follow these installation steps to create Chinook.db in the same directory as this notebook. You can also download and build the database via the command line:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql | sqlite3 Chinook.db

```

Afterwards, place `Chinook.db` in the same directory where this code is running.
